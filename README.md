# The C Programming Language 2nd Edition Solutions

Here are my solutions to the exercises in the book "The C Programming Language" (2nd edition) by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. This book is also referred to as K&R.

I tried to use the best practices with the knowledge learned up to each exercise. The compiler that I used is the __gcc__ from MinGW, a contraction of _"Minimalist GNU for Windows"_. It is a minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications.
